				<h3 style="padding-top:40px;">Why study in UK?</h3>
<p class="text-justify">The UK has been a favourite destination amongst students for many years!</p>
<p class="text-justify">The UK Institutions like the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge
have stood the test of time and have continued to inspire students to become
outstanding individuals and responsible citizens. The UK has a strong Asian
community with people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Nepal.</p>
				<p class="text-justify">Study in the United Kingdom, world’s most popular study destination. Choose from universities
like the Oxford and Cambridge that are synonymous with academic excellence.</p>
                                      <p class="text-justify">England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make up the United Kingdom. There
was a time when the East India Company and the British monarchy ruled over half
the known world. The British had set up trading outposts and colonies, eventually
leaving an English imprint on places as far as Australia, India and the West Indies.
Today, Great Britain has a constitutional monarchy with Queen Elizabeth II, her royal
majesty, on the throne.</p>

										<h3>Education system in the UK</h3>	
                                      <p class="text-justify">It was during the 19th century when a major expansion in the higher education
sector in the UK happened, with the awarding of the royal charters to some of the
prominent UK institutions. Since then, many initiatives were launched to bestow the
university status to some of the institutions, which went on to become the popular
ones in the world.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Public universities dominate the higher education system in the UK, where each
university is an autonomous body and has its own unique entry requirements for its
students. The structure of each university is not ruled by any government but an
independent entity from the university that looks after the financial and strategic
health of the university.</p>
<p class="text-justify">The UK universities are categorised into colleges of different subjects, which means
you need to be sure, beforehand, about which subject you want to study before
applying to a UK college. Unlike in the US where you have an option to choose
electives and switch over to some other subject at the end of first year, UK colleges,
irrespective of being autonomous bodies, expect you to adhere to your choice of
subject. Hence, you either apply at each college of the subject that you are
interested in or you apply through a centralised (common) system that allows you to
apply at various colleges at the same point in time.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Types of higher education institutions in the UK</p>
<p class="text-justify">In addition to universities and colleges, which are recognised institutional bodies
conferring degrees in both undergraduate and postgraduate levels to its students,
there are some institutions that fall in the category of ‘listed bodies’.</p>
<p class="text-justify">Listed bodies do not have any authority to award degrees, but they do offer some
vocational and pathways programmes that may lead to direct employment or
transition to a degree programme.</p>

<p class="text-justify">Each year, the UK draws a high number of students from all over the world. Going by
recent trends, many Indian students study at institutions like the Bangor University,
University of Edinburgh, University of Dundee and the University of Glasgow. This
trend is also linked to the fact that these cities are less expensive when compared
with living in London, Birmingham or Leeds.</p><hr>
<h4>Life in the UK</h4>
<p class="text-justify">Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England all have their specific traits.
Depending on which city you live in, the way of life could differ. For example, you
might find that life in London is hectic and busy while life in Dundee and Bangor is
more relaxed and simple. Punctuality and the queue system are hallmarks of British
life – one is expected to be on time for an appointment, and it is considered impolite
to be late without informing your host or the person whom you are scheduled to 
meet. Queues are commonplace in Great Britain. Whether it is a bank, a railway
station or an airport, one has to wait for one&#39;s turn in queues. There is no shouting
and jostling or shoving of people in queues, and this is a good part of the British
culture.</p></div>
